		<h1> First </h1>
		Earth (or the Earth) is the third planet from the Sun and the densest
		and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is also
		the largest of the Solar System's four terrestrial planets. It is
		sometimes referred to as the World, the Blue Planet,[20] or by its
		Latin name, Terra.[note 6]
		<h2> Second </h2>
		Home to millions of species including humans, Earth is currently the
		only astronomical body where life is known to exist.[21] The planet
		formed 4.54 billion years ago, and life appeared on its surface within
		one
		<h3> Third </h3>
		billion years.[22] Earth's biosphere has significantly altered the
		atmosphere and other abiotic conditions on the planet, enabling the
		proliferation of aerobic organisms as well as the formation of the
		ozone layer which, together with Earth's magnetic field, blocks
		harmful solar radiation, permitting life on land.[23]
		<h3> Third.two </h3>
		The physical properties of the Earth, as well as its geological
		history and orbit, have allowed life to persist during this period.
		The planet is expected to continue supporting life for at least
		another 500 million years.[24][25]
